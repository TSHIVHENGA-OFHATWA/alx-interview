# Minimum Operations

## Description
This project is about calculating the minimum number of operations needed to achieve exactly `n` "H" characters in a text editor starting with just one "H". You can only use two operations:

1. **Copy All**: Copy all the characters in the file.
2. **Paste**: Paste the previously copied characters.

The objective is to determine the fewest number of operations to reach exactly `n` characters.

## Files
- `0-main.py`: Main test file.
- `0-minoperations.py`: Contains the `minOperations` function.
